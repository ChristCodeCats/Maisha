Cassava Safety Instructions
===========================

WARNING: Cassava contains natural cyanide compounds that can cause paralysis (konzo), tropical ataxic neuropathy or even death if not removed.
These steps are essential for safe consumption of bitter cassava.

---------------------------------------
1. Short Wetting Method (SWM) – Best for Emergencies
---------------------------------------
- Peel cassava roots and grate them into flour.
- Place the flour in a shallow bowl or pan.
- Add clean water just enough to wet the flour, stir until all is damp.
- Spread the damp flour in a thin layer on a basket, tray, or cloth.
- Leave it exposed to air and sun for 5 hours, mixing occasionally.
- During this time, cyanide escapes as gas.
- After 5 hours, roast or cook the flour into porridge, ugali, or bread.

This method is simple, quick (same day), and proven to reduce cyanide to safe levels.

---------------------------------------
2. Fermentation (Traditional)
---------------------------------------
- Peel and soak cassava roots in water for 3–4 days.
- Drain, sun-dry, and grind into flour.
- Cyanide is reduced during soaking and drying.

---------------------------------------
3. Sun-Drying
---------------------------------------
- Peel and cut roots into thin chips.
- Spread chips in the sun for several days until fully dry.
- Drying allows cyanide gas to evaporate.
- Grind into flour before use.

---------------------------------------
4. Soaking & Boiling
---------------------------------------
- Peel and cut cassava roots.
- Soak in water for 2–3 days, or boil in plenty of water.
- Always discard the soaking/boiling water (it contains cyanide).
- Cook thoroughly before eating.

---------------------------------------
Final Notes
---------------------------------------
- Bitter cassava MUST ALWAYS be detoxified.
- DO NOT eat raw cassava.
- SWM is fastest and safest where food is urgently needed.
- Sweet cassava varieties (rarely used in Africa) are naturally low in cyanide and do not require these steps.
