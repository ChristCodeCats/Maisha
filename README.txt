Maisha (Swahili: Life)

Survival knowledge in plain .txt files—nothing fancy, just words that work anywhere.
Designed for places with broken supply chains and limited connectivity.

Topics included:
- Health (rehydration, simple remedies, disease prevention)
- Water (basic filtration, boiling, storage)
- Food (safe preparation, emergency staples like maize, cassava)
- Shelter (makeshift homes, protection from elements)
- Energy (cooking, lighting, solar options)

Contributions Wanted:
We welcome help in:
- Translating to local languages (Swahili, French, Hausa, Arabic)
- Adding simple, local tools and tips that survive on their own
- Improving clarity or safety in any file
- Field-testing ideas and sharing what actually works

This is knowledge to help communities stay alive and not be dependent on imports. It’s survival wisdom for anyone who needs it.

Maisha = Life.
