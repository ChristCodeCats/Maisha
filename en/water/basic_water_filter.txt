Basic Water Filter (emergency version)
--------------------------------------
Purpose: remove dirt, worms, and some germs from dirty water.

You need:
- A clean plastic bottle or container
- Gravel (big stones)
- Sand (clean, fine)
- Charcoal (crushed, from wood fire)
- Cloth (to cover bottom)

How to make:
1. Cut bottle bottom off, turn upside down.
2. Place cloth at the “neck” as the last layer.
3. Add layers: gravel on top, then sand, then charcoal.
4. Pour dirty water through slowly.

Result:
- Water looks cleaner, smells better.
- Still boil before drinking if possible!

Note:
This filter reduces dirt and parasites but does NOT kill all germs.
This filter DOES NOT remove harmful chemicals so you need other measures to remove them if you are near a mine.
Always boil or add chlorine if you can.
