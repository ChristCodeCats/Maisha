Handwashing with Plain Water
----------------------------

Even if no soap is available, washing hands with clean water helps remove dirt and germs.

Instructions:
1. Pour water over both hands.
2. Rub hands together thoroughly, including between fingers.
3. Rinse well.
4. Let hands air dry or use a clean cloth if available.

Note: Soap is more effective, but plain water washing is still much better than nothing.
