SOAP FOR HEALTH – SIMPLE GUIDE

WHY IT MATTERS:
Handwashing with soap prevents diarrhea, cholera, and many infections. Soap is cheap to make, but lack of access causes disease outbreaks.

INGREDIENTS:
- Fat or oil (vegetable oil, animal fat, palm oil, shea butter, etc.)
- Ash water (from burned hardwood, banana peels, or plantain peels) OR caustic soda (NaOH) if available
- Clean water

METHOD (traditional ash-based):
1. Burn dry hardwood or plantain peels to fine white ash.
2. Mix ash with water, let sit, and filter to make "lye water."
3. Heat oil/fat gently.
4. Slowly add lye water, stirring continuously.
5. Cook until mixture thickens (like porridge).
6. Pour into molds (wood, gourd, or trays).
7. Let harden for several days before use.

NOTES:
- Caustic soda makes stronger, quicker soap but must be handled with care.
- Soap can also be made into liquid form by adding more water and stirring well.
- Locally scented plants (neem, lemongrass, etc.) can be added for smell and mild antiseptic effect.

SAFETY:
- Always add lye to water, not water to lye.
- Keep children away during production.
- Use gloves or a stick to stir if possible.

SOAP PRODUCTION: COMMON DANGERS & MISTAKES

1. TOO MUCH LYE
- Soap will burn skin, cause rashes, or leave chemical burns.
- Always test: touch a little soap to the tongue. If it "bites" sharply, it has excess lye.

2. TOO LITTLE LYE
- Soap remains greasy or soft, does not clean properly.
- Germs remain on skin if soap is weak.

3. WEAK OR BAD ASH
- If ash solution is too weak, soap never hardens.
- If ash is contaminated (e.g. with soil or waste), soap may carry disease.

4. DIRTY WATER
- Using river or pond water introduces germs.
- Always boil water or use clean rainwater before mixing.

5. INSUFFICIENT CURING
- Soap must cure (dry and neutralize) for at least 2–4 weeks.
- Fresh soap may still contain lye and burn skin.

6. CONTAMINATION DURING CURING
- Keep soap in clean, dry, airy place.
- Mold, insects, or dirt can ruin soap and make it unsafe.

7. USING SOAP TOO SOON
- Soap looks ready in days, but only time removes hidden lye.
- Patience = safety.
