# Maisha (Swahili: Life)

This repository is survival knowledge in plain .txt files.  
No formatting, no heavy files, just text that works anywhere.  
It is for anyone in need: Africa, Asia, or anywhere resources fail.  

Topics:
- Health (simple medicine, rehydration, prevention)
- Water (filtering, boiling, storage)
- Food (safe preparation, small farming)
- Shelter (basic construction, emergency)
- Energy (cooking, light, solar)

Goal: Life is for everyone. Knowledge should not be locked away.  

Maisha = Life.
